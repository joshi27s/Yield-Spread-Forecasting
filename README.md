# Yield-Spread-Forecasting
Time series analysis and forecasting using classical econometric and novel deep learning methods

In this research paper, I have applied various econometric time series and two machine learning methods to forecast the
daily data on the yield spread the
difference between the 10-year Treasury yields and the 3-month Treasury bills. First,
I decomposed the yield curve into its principal components, then simulated various paths of the yield spread using the
Vasicek model. After constructing univariate ARIMA models, and multivariate models such as ARIMAX, VAR and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), I calibrated the root mean squared error (RMSE) to measure how far the modelsâ€™
results deviate from the current values. Through impulse response functions, I measured the impact of various shocks on
the difference yield spread. The results indicate that the simple univariate ARIMA model (RMSE = 0.05185)
outperforms the more complicated VAR method (RMSE = 0.4648) , and the complex LSTM with multivariate data
performs equally well as the simple ARIMA model.
